# VoiceCheck-IA
Background application that allows you to verify the authenticity of a call to avoid extortion by detecting whether the voice is from a real user or is generated by AI.

## Voice Classifier con Blockchain

This project implements a voice classification system that distinguishes between real human voices and those generated by artificial intelligence (AI), such as ElevenLabs or Bark. It uses deep learning models (CNN+LSTM) on audio spectrograms and a blockchain to securely log prediction results.

## üöÄ Features

- Audio classifier based on spectrograms.
- CNN + LSTM neural network architecture to capture spatial and temporal patterns.
- Immutable prediction logging via local blockchain.
- Audio file traceability through SHA-256 hashing.
- Ready for integration with real-time verification processes.

## üß† Model Architecture

- Input: Spectrograms generated from `.wav` files..
- Neural Network: Convolutions + LSTM + Dense layer.
- Output: A value between 0 (AI-generated voice) and 1 (real human voice).
